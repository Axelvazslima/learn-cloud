# Introduction

## Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

It lets you provision a logically isolated section on the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

These resources can be public facing (internet access) or private facing (no internet access).

### Subnets

```sh
Public and private grouping of resources -> ranges of IP addresses in your VPC.
```
