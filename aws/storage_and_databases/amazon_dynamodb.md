# Amazon DynamoDB

## Nonrelational databases

```sh
It structures data in a way differently to rows and columns, such as key-value pairs.
```

> NoSQL databases.

Works similarly to *dictionaries* in Python or *Maps* in Java.

Store you data in tables and query it from it.

Add or remove attributes at any time.

```sh
key = 1, values = {Name: Axel, Age: 20, Interests: [cloud computing, aws]}
```

## Amazon DynamoDB

```sh
It is a key-value databases that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
```

It is *serverless*, so you don't need to manage underlying infrastructure.

It has *auto scaling*, so it adjusts to your needs, growing and shrinking when needed.

**Suitable for** cases you need *high performance while scaling*.
