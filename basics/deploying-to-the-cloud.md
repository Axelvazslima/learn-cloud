# Deploying to the cloud

Different levels of control, flexibility and management.

## Deployment models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Basic building blocks for cloud IT.

Access to networking features, computers and data storage space.

Highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.

```sh
Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Realtional Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon Route 53.
```

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Removes the needs for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and OS).

Focus on deployment and management of applications.

Efficiency -> No need for worrying about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintence and patching.

```sh
AWS Elastic Beanstalk -> Quickly deploying and scaling web applications.
```

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software product that the service provider runs and manages.

No need to think about infrastructure is managed or the service is maintained. You only need to know how to use the software.

```sh
Video meeting sites, eail sites, file sharing sites and messaging apps...
```

## Deployment strategies

### Cloud

Migrate existing apps to the cloud or start new ones.

Build those apps on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them.

Or, build them on higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting and scalling requirements of the core infrastructre.

```sh
Company building an app that consists of virtual servers, databases and networking component that are fully based in the cloud.
```

### Hybrid

Integrate it in IT legacy apps.

Somethings may need to be on cloud and some may need to be on-premises.

```sh
A company wants to use cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are more suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud.
```

### On-premises

Private cloud deployment.

Resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.

Increase resource utilization by using applucation management and virtualization technologies.

```sh
You can keep apps fully on your on-premises data center. Even though it's much more commom on legacy IT infrastructure, its incorporation of appliacation management and virtualization technoplogie helps to increase resource utilization.
```
