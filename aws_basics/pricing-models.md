# AWS Pricing Models

AWS has three main pricing models.

## Pay-as-you-go

Easily adapt to changing business needs and improve your responsiveness to changes, without overcommitting your budgets.

Adapt your business based on need and not forecasts, thus reducing the risk of overprovisioning or missing capacity.

## Save when you reserve

'Purchasing reserving instances'.

Save money for commitment. Commit for a specific time period to that service and save money, like a recurrency model.

This amount is measured in $/hour of an AWS service or a category of services, for a 1-year or 3-year period.
```

## Pay less by using more

You can get volume-based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases.

For services, such as Amazon S3, pricing is tiered, which means that the more you use it, the less you pay for it - per GB.
